# <ins>Project Name</ins> :- TO-DO LIST APPLICATION WITH LOCAL STORAGE

The **To-Do App** HTML structure is a simple and interactive application designed to help users create, manage, and keep track of their tasks efficiently. This code provides a basic user interface where users can add items to their to-do list and view them in an organized format.

### Key Components:
1. **Header and Styling**:
   - The app uses a clean, modern font (Poppins) sourced from Google Fonts to improve readability and design.
   - An external stylesheet (`style.css`) is linked to control the layout, colors, and other visual aspects of the page.

2. **Input Form for Adding Tasks**:
   - A form with an ID of `form` contains an input field (`todoInput`) where users can type their tasks. This input field is placed within a "form-group" div to organize form elements.
   - A button labeled "Add List" (`addBtn`) allows users to add the entered task to the to-do list when clicked.

3. **To-Do List Display Area**:
   - The `todo-list-wrapper` section contains an unordered list (`listGroup`) where each task added by the user is dynamically displayed. This list is updated in real-time as tasks are added or removed.

4. **JavaScript for Interactivity**:
   - The `script.js` file, included with the `defer` attribute to ensure it loads after HTML, is used to manage the functionality of the to-do list, such as adding tasks to the list and possibly marking or deleting them.
   - The app also links to the Ionicons library, which can be used to add icons for task items (like check or delete symbols) to enhance the user experience.

This To-Do App is designed to be intuitive and straightforward, allowing users to easily enter, view, and manage their tasks. The modular structure makes it easy to add more features, such as marking tasks as complete or filtering them by status.![Screenshot 2024-11-15 112217](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9b620bf7-b263-4132-97db-0c1599d6b971)
